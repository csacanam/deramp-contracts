## Test Data Patterns

### Standard Test Setup

- Multiple signers (owner, commerce, payer, treasury, unauthorized)
- Multiple test tokens (ERC20 with different decimals)
- Realistic amounts (1 wei to 1000 ETH)
- Proper role assignments
- Whitelist configurations

### Fee Testing

- Default fee: 1% (100 basis points)
- Custom fee: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- Zero fee: 0%
- Maximum fee: 100% (10000 basis points)

### Volume Testing

- Single transactions
- Batch operations (10-20 transactions)
- High volume (50+ transactions)
- Concurrent operations
- Multi-token scenarios

## Assertion Patterns

### Balance Verification

```typescript
expect(await storage.balances(commerce, token)).to.equal(expectedAmount);
expect(await storage.serviceFeeBalances(token)).to.equal(expectedFee);
```

### Event Verification

```typescript
await expect(transaction)
  .to.emit(contract, "EventName")
  .withArgs(param1, param2, param3);
```

### State Verification

```typescript
const invoice = await storage.invoices(invoiceId);
expect(invoice.status).to.equal(1); // PAID
expect(invoice.paidAmount).to.equal(paymentAmount);
```

### Error Verification

```typescript
await expect(transaction).to.be.revertedWith("Expected error message");
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### Test Organization

- Descriptive test names
- Logical grouping by functionality
- Proper setup and teardown
- Isolated test cases

### Data Management

- Fresh state for each test
- Realistic test data
- Proper token approvals
- Clean environment setup

### Error Testing

- Comprehensive error scenarios
- Proper error message validation
- Edge case coverage
- Security validation

### Performance Testing

- Gas usage optimization
- Concurrent operation handling
- High volume scenarios
- System capacity testing

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing

- All tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated
- Gas usage tracking
- Performance benchmarks

### Quality Gates

- 100% test pass rate required
- Minimum coverage thresholds
- Gas usage limits
- Security validations

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Token Approval**: Ensure proper token approvals before payments
2. **Role Assignment**: Verify correct role assignments for operations
3. **Whitelist Setup**: Confirm tokens and commerces are whitelisted
4. **Balance Validation**: Check sufficient balances before operations

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run with verbose output
npx hardhat test --verbose

# Run specific test with logs
npx hardhat test test/PaymentProcessor.test.ts --logs

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Deramp modular system is thoroughly validated and production-ready.
